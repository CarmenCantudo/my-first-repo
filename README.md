# My very first website

Welcome to my very first website!

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

You can check out the website [here!](https://carmencantudo.github.io/my-first-repo/)

## Project Description
This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like Cloud9, Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. The project itself will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each of the different sections of the program.

This is the first project that I've pushed to a remote repository using Git and GitHub.


## Technologies Used
In this project we used some simple HTML5 and CSS3 to build the project, we wrote our code using the Cloud9 IDE, and we've backed it up using Git and GitHub.

This project is currently hosted on [GitHub pages](https://carmencantudo.github.io/my-first-repo/).
